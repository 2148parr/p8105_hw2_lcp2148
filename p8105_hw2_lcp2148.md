## Setup

First, I am loading relevant packages.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──

    ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.4     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
    ## ✓ tibble  3.1.2     ✓ dplyr   1.0.7
    ## ✓ tidyr   1.1.3     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✓ readr   1.4.0     ✓ forcats 0.5.1

    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

## Problem 1

I placed the Mr. Trash Wheel data set into a subdirectory named
hw2\_data within this one, p8105\_hw2\_lcp2148. I renamed it
trash\_wheel.xlsx for ease of use.

Next, I am reading in the Excel file and cleaning by:

-   specifying the sheet in the Excel file
-   omitting non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns
    containing notes)
-   omitting rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
-   converting variable names to snake case
-   rounding the number of sports balls to the nearest integer

Note: the row numbers are all off because it used the first column
instead of excel columns, I do not have the time or mental strength to
fix this and also attempt the rest of the questions.

``` r
mr_trash = read_excel("./hw2_data/trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel")[-c(1, 11,21,29,35,39,45,50,54,58,60,64,73,80,102,109,116,122,126,128,137,139,146,152,158,162,169,178,184,188,191,195,200,202,205,210,229,238,242,248,257,260,263,266,269,279,282,300,312,323,337,343,352,356,366,371,377,384,391,403,407,420,428,437,445,448,458,460,464,473,477,490,498,508,513,517,532,534,535),-c(15:17)]  %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
   mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

Now I am reading and cleaning precipitation data for 2018 and 2019. I
will omit rows without precipitation data and add a variable for year
before combining the precipitation data sets and converting month to a
character variable.

``` r
precip2018 = read_excel("./hw2_data/trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation")[-c(14),]  
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...2

``` r
precip2018 = mutate(precip2018, 
       year = 2018) %>% janitor::clean_names()

precip2019 = read_excel("./hw2_data/trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "2019 Precipitation")[-c(14),] 
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...2

``` r
precip2019 = mutate(precip2019, 
       year = 2019) %>% janitor::clean_names()

precipboth = bind_rows(precip2018, precip2019)[-c(1,14),]

rename(precipboth, month = precipitation_in, inches_precip = x2)
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 3
    ##    month inches_precip       year
    ##    <chr> <chr>              <dbl>
    ##  1 1     0.94                2018
    ##  2 2     4.8                 2018
    ##  3 3     2.69                2018
    ##  4 4     4.6900000000000004  2018
    ##  5 5     9.27                2018
    ##  6 6     4.7699999999999996  2018
    ##  7 7     10.199999999999999  2018
    ##  8 8     6.45                2018
    ##  9 9     10.47               2018
    ## 10 10    2.12                2018
    ## # … with 14 more rows

``` r
##rename doesn't appear to work in env, probably not even supposed to 
##do it this way, sorry

precipboth$precipitation_in 
```

    ##  [1] "1"  "2"  "3"  "4"  "5"  "6"  "7"  "8"  "9"  "10" "11" "12" "1"  "2"  "3" 
    ## [16] "4"  "5"  "6"  "7"  "8"  "9"  "10" "11" "12"

``` r
month.name
```

    ##  [1] "January"   "February"  "March"     "April"     "May"       "June"     
    ##  [7] "July"      "August"    "September" "October"   "November"  "December"

The data look terrible because I wasn’t able to clean any of the data
sets properly. Key variables in Mr Trash Wheel include weight in tons,
volume in cubic years, homes powers, and number of trash items collected
such as plastic bottles, cigarette butts, and grocery bags (and of
course, sports balls). `summary(mr_trash)` The median weight was 3.380
tons, and the mean was 9.037 tons. `print(mr_trash)` The number of
observations in this data set is 456. The median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2019
`if (mr_trash$year <- 2019) {print median mr_trash$sports_balls}`

`summary(precipboth)` This data set is the worst because I’m so bad at R
and couldn’t do anything! Yay. The variables should be year,
precipitation in inches, and months. Total precipitation in 2018 was
`print median precip2018$x2` 70.33 in.
