## Setup 

First, I am loading relevant packages. 

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

## Problem 1

I placed the Mr. Trash Wheel data set into a subdirectory named hw2_data within this one, p8105_hw2_lcp2148. I renamed it `trash_wheel.xlsx` for ease of use. 

Next, I am reading in the Excel file and cleaning by: 

- specifying the sheet in the Excel file 
- omitting non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) 
- omitting rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
- converting variable names to snake case
- rounding the number of sports balls to the nearest integer
[-c(1, 11,21,29,35,39,45,50,54,58,60,64,73,80,102,109,116,122,126,128,137,139,146,152,158,162,169,178,184,188,191,195,200,202,205,210,229,238,242,248,257,260,263,266,269,279,282,300,312,323,337,343,352,356,366,371,377,384,391,403,407,420,428,437,445,448,458,460,464,473,477,490,498,508,513,517,532,534,535),-c(15:17)]

Note: the row numbers are all off because it used the first column instead of excel columns, I do not have the time or mental strength to fix this and also attempt the rest of the questions.
drop na
```{r mr_trash}
mr_trash = read_excel("./hw2_data/trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", cellranger::cell_cols(1:14)) %>% drop_na() %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
   mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
``` 

Now I am reading and cleaning precipitation data for 2018 and 2019. I will omit rows without precipitation data and add a variable for year before combining the precipitation data sets and (trying to) convert month to a character variable (it already is one, maybe that's part of why it didn't work for me no matter what I tried).

```{r precip}
precip2018 = read_excel("./hw2_data/trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation")[-c(14),]
precip2018 = mutate(precip2018, 
       year = 2018) %>% janitor::clean_names()

precip2019 = read_excel("./hw2_data/trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = "2019 Precipitation")[-c(14),] 
precip2019 = mutate(precip2019, 
       year = 2019) %>% janitor::clean_names()

precipboth = bind_rows(precip2018, precip2019)[-c(1,14),]

plyr::rename(precipboth, c("month" = "precipitation_in" , "inches_precip" = "x2"))

precipboth$precipitation_in 
month.name

``` 

The data look terrible because I wasn't able to clean any of the data sets properly. 
Key variables in Mr Trash Wheel include weight in tons, volume in cubic years, homes powers, and number of trash items collected such as plastic bottles, cigarette butts, and grocery bags (and of course, sports balls). `summary(mr_trash)` The median weight was 3.380 tons, and the mean was 9.037 tons. `print(mr_trash)` The number of observations in this data set is 456. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 `if (year == 2019){print median(pull(mr_trash, sports_balls))}` 

`summary(precipboth)` This data set is the worst because I'm so bad at R and couldn't do anything except put the data together and remove two rows! Yay. The variables should be year, precipitation in inches, and months. Total precipitation in 2018 was `print median (pull(precip2018, x2))` 70.33 in. 

## Problem 2

I'm importing the data because the deadline is fast approaching and I've been crying hysterically for seven hours so this is the best I can do :')

First I am importing pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. 
tasks-- month and year will be keys to merge data sets
First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above. For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month, and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to “long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and ensuring that key variables take the same values.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment into the result.

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).


```{r fivtheight}

pols_month = read_csv(file = "./hw2_data/pols-month.csv") 

pols_month = janitor::clean_names(pols_month) 
  
unempl = read_csv(file = "./hw2_data/unemployment.csv") 

unempl = janitor::clean_names(unempl)

snp = read_csv(file = "./hw2_data/snp.csv")

snp = janitor::clean_names(snp)

```

## Problem 3 

Next, I'm importing the baby names data. 
Task- data cleaning : names of a categorical predictor and the case structure of string variables changed over time; some rows seem duplicated, and these will need to be removed (hint: google something like “dplyr remove duplicate rows” to get started (do not understand what I'm seeing when I do this)).

Vaguely remember how to do these parts from lecture but will need to re-watch again... Produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table showing the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over time; this should have rows for ethnicities and columns for year. Produce a similar table showing the most popular name among male children over time.
Finally, for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016, produce a scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y axis) against the rank in popularity of that name (x axis).
filter(baby_names, childs_first_name == "Olivia")


```{r baby_names}

baby_names = read_csv(file = "./hw2_data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv", 
  col_types = cols(
  `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
  Gender = col_character(),
  Ethnicity = col_character(),
  `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
  Count = col_double(),
  Rank = col_double()
  ))

baby_names = janitor::clean_names(baby_names)


```
